# Appetizing Donut Secret

## Question

> The Neble-Trutwerth Family Shop, famous in town for their amazing donuts, has contacted you because an unexpected family death means no one has the secret recipe any more. The original owner always said he had the recipe hidden on his favorite flash drive, but the family couldn't find the donut recipe when they plugged it in. They've given you an image of the drive, so it's up to you to find the recipe and save the town's beloved donut shop!

## Solution

Open the file on an [online hexadecimal editor](https://hexed.it/#base64:SECRETS.dsk;b3N1Y3Rme3AxYW5rNzBuX2M0bjdfbnRmNX0=) and ctrl + F "ctf"

## Solution (by bricks)

The first thing I tried was opening the file in [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) to get more info on it. Then, I discovered I could see more files inside of the Secrets file. I immediately fell for the bait images of assorted memes that were named like a solution. I eventually narrowed my search down to one file but it would not open for me. I right clicked the file and selected "alternate streams". This lead me to a textfile that contained the flag.

I used xxd, piped the output into 'less' and searched for 'osuctf'

strings SECRETS| grep osu

## Solution (by Something witty ðŸ˜›)

If you do testdisk SECRETS (with "None" partition), it will list all the files that had been deleted on the drive. You can copy all those files out to your current directory and then use grep on those files to search for a the flag.
