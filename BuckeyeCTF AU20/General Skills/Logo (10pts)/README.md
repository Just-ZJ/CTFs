## Solution
Just upload the image to [this website](https://29a.ch/photo-forensics/#level-sweep) and you will be able to see the flag. Had to mess around the website options a little before the level sweep shows me the flag

Luckily stegoveritas awesome_logo.png was able to generate some interesting images. In particular awesome_logo.png_Red_1.png shows the flag very clearly as: osuctf{k0N7RaS7_1s_PR377Y_k3wl}

Go to [https://stegonline.georgeom.net/upload](https://stegonline.georgeom.net/upload), upload the image, and click LSB. The flag will appear.

We opened the file and found this SICK logo. Upon inspection it didn't look like much and gave up. After our cap took a look at it, he noticed that the center white area was not entirely white. This was due to his crappy monitor. Open the file in paint, grab the black paint bucket, spill black paint all over the background shows the flag clearly on the screen. Nice! The only flag we could solve.
