## Question

> You discover that a spy has infiltrated the OSU campus and is sending secrets back to "that state up north" by transmitting a signal at constant output power to some receiver stations placed around campus when they go on their daily walk. Hoping to capture the secret messages, you find each of the stations, connect to a debug port, and record the output. The combined output of the debug ports is available in the provided file. Looks like you still have some decoding to do... what are all these Received Power values good for?
> Challenge creator's notes:
> - To confirm the previous update, it is intended that you are given Received Power values, not RSSI and not (directly) distance
> - This challenge is not meant to be tied to any real-world location.
> - You can ignore (or "make reasonable assumptions" about) details for any antennas or wavelengths for this problem. You shouldn't have to think about them to solve this problem.
